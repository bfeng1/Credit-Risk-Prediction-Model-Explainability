## objectives
* Perform EDA to understand the what features could indicate the risk of loan default
* Build a classification model to predict the potential default loans
* Use grid search for hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance on the random forest tree model.
* Use permutation importance to understand which features are the most critical for the overall model performance
* Use SHAP to form a better understanding how the chosen model is working to make each predictions. This is able to help us understand how the values within each feature affect the prediction.
* Through the exercise, understand the process of credit risk analysis in banking.
